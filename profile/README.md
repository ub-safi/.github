## Our Approach

The task of engineering increasingly sophisticated smart and interconnected systems has become commonplace in the automotive and aerospace industries. This demands a fresh approach and new sets of skills to overcome complexity and multidisciplinary challenges.

**Scope**: The scope of SAFI is to design, develop, and market instructional products and services (courses, workshops, demos, etc) for industry. SAFI is committed to high quality instructional and educational training, and provides a core deliverable of programmes, courses, and learning objects for the distance education, distributed learning, and e-learning markets.

**Methodology**: SAFI employs an object-oriented training methodology that yields flexible, scalable, and reusable content, supporting clients with rich, targeted courses which lead to fast implementation. Our training seeks to offer a balanced portfolio that mitigate business fluctuations and growth.
